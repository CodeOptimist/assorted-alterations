  <description><![CDATA[<color=teal><b>Deny distant material supply jobs.</b></color>
Won't supply directly from a resource if hauling it to storage would bring it closer to the given blueprint.
(Recommended with <color=grey><b><i>Mehni's</i> Pick Up And Haul</b></color> as only haul jobs utilize inventory.)

<color=teal><b>Default ingredient search radius.</b></color>
New bills will be created with this radius.

<color=teal><b>Pause on "beginning their assault".</b></color>
When a staged attack actually commences, not just appears.

<color=teal><b>Shift+scroll cycle area restrictions.</b></color>
Shift + scroll wheel on area restrictions will cycle them for all listed pawns (colonist or animal).
Also recommended: <color=grey><b><i>VouLT's</i> Better Pawn Control</b></color> for policies.

<color=teal><b>Butcher small creatures.</b></color>
Conserve freezer space with a <= 75 meat yielding creature recipe.

<color=teal><b>Meat-counting butcher recipes.</b></color>
Different recipes to count various combinations of animal, human, and insect.

<color=teal><b>Separate cannibal and insect meals to avoid ingredient mixing.</b></color>
Supports non-vanilla insectoid and humanlike.
Disallowed in starting food restrictions by default.

To preserve balance these extra meal types have:
* Disabled generation (e.g. resource pod drop, map prisoner cell spawn).
* Disabled buying (trade stock generation).
* Disabled scatter on map generation.

<color=teal><b>Patch <color=grey><b>Better Pawn Control</b></color> for newborns.</b></color>
Hatched and birthed animals will inherit the entire restriction policy of their parent.
